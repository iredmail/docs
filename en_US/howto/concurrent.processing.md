# Process more emails concurrently

!!! attention

    Processing more emails concurrently requires more RAM, please make sure you
    have enough RAM to handle them, otherwise ClamAV may exit randomly due to
    no enough memory (for ClamAV).

Amavisd-new is content filter, it invokes SpamAssassin and ClamAV for
spam/virus scanning, it also offers additional features like DKIM signing and
verification.

In [Amavisd config file](./file.location.html#amavisd), `$max_servers` sets
the number of concurrent Amavisd processes and it must match the number set
in `/etc/postfix/master.cf` `maxproc` column for the `smtp-amavis` service.
Sample settings:

```
# File: /etc/amavis/conf.d/50-user

$max_servers = 4;
```

```
# File: /etc/postfix/master.cf

smtp-amavis unix -  -   -   -   4  smtp
    ...
```

Both values should be identical for two reasons: If Amavisd offers more
processes than Postfix will ever use, Amavisd wastes resources. On the other
hand, if Postfix starts more dedicated transports than amavisd can handle
simultaneously, e-mail transport will be refused and logged as error.

If many emails stalled in mail queue (check with command `postqueue -p`), and
your server has powerful CPU and memory, you can increase the number of
concurrent Amavisd processes, so that it can process more emails at the same
time. Sample setting:

```
# File: /etc/amavisd/amavisd.conf

$max_servers = 10;
```
Restarting Amavisd service is required.

```
# File: /etc/postfix/master.cf

smtp-amavis unix -  -   -   -   10  smtp
    ...
```

Note: If you don't want to modify `/etc/postfix/master.cf`, it's ok to set
`smtp-amavis_destination_concurrency_limit = 10` in `/etc/postfix/main.cf`
instead.

Restarting Postfix service is required if you modified `/etc/postfix/master.cf`,
reloading OR restarting is required if you modified `/etc/postfix/main.cf`.
