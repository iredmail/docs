## System Requirements

!!! warning

    * iRedMail is designed to be deployed on a dedicated server, which means you
      can not have other network services running on the server __BEFORE__
      iRedMail installation.
    * iRedMail will install and configure all required software automatically.
    * Many ISPs block port 25 by default, it's used for communication between
      mail servers, it must be open, otherwise your server may be not able to
      receive or / and send emails. Please contact your ISP to make sure it's
      not blocked, or ask them to unblock.

          - Amazon AWS EC2. Request to [remove the throttle on port 25](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/ec2-port-25-throttle/).
          - Google Cloud Platform.
          - Microsoft Azure.
          - Linode. Explained in the [blog post](https://www.linode.com/blog/linode/a-new-policy-to-help-fight-spam/),
            you can open a support ticket to request the Linode team to open it. If you [sign up to Linode with our reference](https://www.linode.com/?r=b4d04083428fb99ce452d84b57253d11692a0850), iRedMail Team's Linode account will receive a credit of $15-20.00. Thanks.
          - DigitalOcean. According to [a post in their community](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/questions/port-25-465-is-blocked-how-can-i-enable-it), __SEEMS__ impossible to unblock port 25, that means you can __NOT__ run mail server on DigitalOcean VPS.

### Supported Linux and BSD distribution releases

Linux/BSD distribution releases supported by __iRedMail Easy__:

Distribution | Release Versions
--- |---
CentOS | 8, 9 (recommended)
Debian | 10, 11 (recommended)
Ubuntu | 20.04, 22.04 (recommended)
OpenBSD | 7.3

If you need to install iRedMail on FreeBSD, please use the [downloadable
installer](https://www.iredmail.org/download.html) instead.

### Hardware Requirements

* iRedMail requires at least `4 GB` memory for a low traffic production server.
* If you plan to run SOGo Groupware (which offers webmail, calendar (CalDAV),
  contacts (CardDAV) and ActiveSync), you need a lot more memory. Consider 16
  GB memory to support 500 ActiveSync clients.

## Sign up and login

To deploy a mail server, you need to sign up with a valid email
address first:

* [Sign Up or Login: https://easy.iredmail.org/](https://easy.iredmail.org)

It will send you an email to confirm you're the owner of the email address,
please click the link in the email to confirm, then login.

After signed up, you get one-month trial for free to evaluate the iRedMail Easy
platform, if you don't like it, or don't need it, feel free to remove your own
account in `Profile` page on the left sidebar after logged in.

## Add a new mail server

After login, you will be redirected to the `Dashboard` page, please click the
`Add a mail server` button to add a new mail server.

![](./images/iredmail-easy/installation/add_mailserver.png){: width="600px" }

Explanation of the form fields:

* `Hostname (FQDN)`: This is the server hostname you want to set for the mail server.

    * It must be a fully qualified domain name (FQDN), for example,
      `mail.example.com`, `mx.example.com`.
    * This hostname can __NOT__ be used as a virtual mail domain (used in email
      address like `user@example.com`) because it's used to accept email sent
      to Linux/BSD system account like `root` user.

* `IP Address`: Public or private IP address of your mail server.

    If this mail server is in internal network and can not be accessed directly
    from external network, you need a Jump Server (or, Bastion Server) so that
    our deployment server can connect to your mail server. For more details
    about Jump Server, please read this short tutorial: [What is SSH jump
    server](./iredmail-easy.what.is.ssh.jump.server.html).

* `SSH Port`: SSH service port number. Defaults to 22.
* `SSH User`: The login username for ssh secure connection. Defaults to `root`.

    If you use a non-root user, `sudo` on Linux or `doas` on OpenBSD is
    required to gain root privilege.

* `SSH Key`: The SSH key used to login to your mail server.

    If you choose option `Generate one for me`, after submitted this form,
    our system will generate a strong (4096 bits) SSH key for you.

* `OS`: Choose the Linux/BSD distribution and release version of your mail
  server.
* `Deployment Server`: Please choose one deployment server from the list.

    A deployment server connects to your mail server to deploy or upgrade,
    please choose the nearest one for faster network connection.

    If your mail server sits behind a firewall, please whitelist the IP address
    of selected deployment server.

* `Comment`: Add some text to help you identify this mail server.

Click the button to create mail server, after created, page will be redirected
to mail server profile page.  You're free to update profile here.

## Choose preferred backend

Click tab `Backend` on the mail server profile page.

A backend is a SQL or LDAP database used to store mail domains and
accounts. We suggest you choose the one you're familiar with for easier
maintenance.

## Choose the components you want to deploy

Click tab `Components` on the mail server profile page.

A component is a software (or software group) which implements some network
service(s). On this page you can choose the components you want to deploy on
your mail server.

Click tab `Deployment` on the mail server profile page.

Please run the commands displayed on this page on your mail server, it will
download a shell script to simplify ssh public key setup. If ssh login user is
not `root`, it will help setup `sudo` (on Linux) or `doas` (on OpenBSD) also.

![](./images/iredmail-easy/installation/deployment.png){: width="900px" }

After you ran the commands, it's ready to deployment. Click the button
`Perform Full Deployment` to start the deployment.

Depends on the components you selected, and network connection speed between
your server and our deployment server, it may take few minutes or even longer
to finish. Please be patient.

It will refresh the page every 5 seconds and show you the latest output of
deployment task, you can watch and (hopefully) have some fun. :)
