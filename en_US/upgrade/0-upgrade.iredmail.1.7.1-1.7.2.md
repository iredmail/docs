- Jan 24, 2025: initial publish.

## General (All backends should apply these changes)

### Update `/etc/iredmail-release` with new iRedMail version number

iRedMail stores the release version in `/etc/iredmail-release` after
installation, it's recommended to update this file after you upgraded iRedMail,
so that you can know which version of iRedMail you're running. For example:

```
1.7.2
```

### Upgrade iRedAPD (Postfix policy server) to the latest stable release (5.8.1)

Please follow below tutorial to upgrade iRedAPD to the latest stable release:
[Upgrade iRedAPD to the latest stable release](./upgrade.iredapd.html)

### Upgrade mlmmjadmin to the latest stable release (3.3.0)

Please follow below tutorial to upgrade mlmmjadmin to the latest stable release:
[Upgrade mlmmjadmin to the latest stable release](./upgrade.mlmmjadmin.html)

### Upgrade Roundcube webmail to the latest stable release (1.6.9 or 1.5.9)

!!! warning "CentOS 7: please stick to Roundcube 1.5.2"

    __It's time to leave your comfort zone and upgrade this server to at least
    CentOS Stream 8 or [Rocky Linux 8](https://docs.rockylinux.org/guides/migrate2rocky/).__

    If you're running CentOS 7, please upgrade to Roundcube 1.5.2 instead.
    Roundcube 1.5.3 requires PHP-7, but CentOS 7 ships PHP-5.4 which is not
    supported by Roundcube 1.5.3 and later releases, including 1.6.x.

    __Unfortunately, Roundcube 1.5.2 does NOT contains multiple security fixes
    which shipped in Roundcube 1.5.6 and 1.6.5.__

!!! warning "Ubuntu 18.04: please stick to Roundcube 1.5.9"

    Ubuntu 18.04 runs old php version which is not supported by Roundcube 1.6.

* [Upgrade Roundcube](https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/wiki/Upgrade).

### Upgrade netdata to the latest stable release (v2.1.1)

If you have netdata installed, you can upgrade it by following this tutorial:

### Fixed: incorrect sql column name in Fail2ban script

```
wget -O /usr/local/bin/fail2ban_banned_db \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iredmail/iRedMail/1.7.2/samples/fail2ban/bin/fail2ban_banned_db
```

### Fixed: Not serve ACME challenge over HTTP directly

Let's Encrypt cert renewal may fail with error `Connection refused` if the
HTTP request is redirected to HTTPS.

- Replace `/etc/nginx/sites-available/00-default.conf` by content below:

```
#
# Note: This file must be loaded before other virtual host config files,
#
# HTTP
server {
    # Listen on ipv4
    listen 80;
    #listen [::]:80;

    server_name _;

    # Allow ACME challenge to be served over HTTP (don't redirect to HTTPS).
    location ~* ^/.well-known/acme-challenge/ {
        root /opt/www/well_known;
        try_files $uri =404;
        allow all;
    }

    # Redirect all insecure http requests to https.
    location / {
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    }
}
```

- Create new directory `/opt/www/well_known`, set correct owner, group and
  permission, then restart Nginx service:

```
mkdir -p /opt/www/well_known
chown root:root /opt/www/well_known
chmod 0755 /opt/www/well_known
service nginx restart
```

Note: If you renew cert with `certbot` program and `--webroot` argument,
you must replace old directory in `/etc/letsencrypt/renewal/*.conf` by
`/opt/www/well_known` manaully. Also, to request new ssl cert with `--webroot`
argument, please specify `-w /opt/www/well_known` each time.
