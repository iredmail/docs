related) server settings on web UI.

We encourage all users to deploy new iRedMail servers with iRedMail Pro and
keep the servers up to date.

If you prefer classic downloadable iRedMail installer, you can find the
installation guides here: [Install iRedMail](./index.html#install).

## System Requirements

!!! warning

    * iRedMail is designed to be deployed on a fresh / clean server, which means you
      can not have other network services running on the server __BEFORE__
      iRedMail installation.
    * iRedMail will install and configure all required software automatically.
    * Many ISPs block port 25 by default, it's used for communication between
      mail servers, it must be open, otherwise your server may be not able to
      receive or / and send emails. Please contact your ISP to make sure it's
      not blocked, or ask them to unblock.

          - Amazon AWS EC2. Request to [remove the throttle on port 25](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/ec2-port-25-throttle/).
          - Google Cloud Platform.
          - Microsoft Azure.
          - Linode. Explained in the [blog post](https://www.linode.com/blog/linode/a-new-policy-to-help-fight-spam/),
            you can open a support ticket to request the Linode team to open it. If you [sign up to Linode with our reference](https://www.linode.com/?r=b4d04083428fb99ce452d84b57253d11692a0850), iRedMail Team's Linode account will receive a credit of $15-20.00. Thanks.
          - DigitalOcean. According to [a post in their community](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/questions/port-25-465-is-blocked-how-can-i-enable-it), __SEEMS__ impossible to unblock port 25, that means you can __NOT__ run mail server on DigitalOcean VPS.

A backend is a SQL or LDAP database used to store mail domains and
accounts. There're not big differences between them, so we suggest you choose
the one you're familiar with for easier maintenance.
